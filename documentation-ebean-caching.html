        <p>When we want to talk about caching for performance we are talking about the "Level 2" cache or the "server cache".  It is cal ed the "Level 2 cache" because the persistence context is often referred to as the "Level 1 cache".</p>
        <p>The goal of the L2 server cache is to gain very significant performance improvement by not having to hit the database.</p>
        <h2>Bean and Query caches</h2>
        <p>Ebean has 2 types of caches – Bean caches and Query caches.</p>
        <b>Bean Caches</b>
        <p>Bean caches hold entity beans and are keyed by their Id values.</p>
        <b>Query Caches</b>
        <p>Query caches hold the results of queries (Lists, Sets, Maps of entity beans) and are keyed by the query hash value (effectively a hash of the query and its bind values).</p>
        <p>The entries in a query cache are invalidated by <i><b>ANY</b></i> change to the underlying table – insert, update or delete. This means that the query cache is only useful on entities that are infrequently modified (typical y "lookup tables" such as countries, currencies, status codes etc).</p>
        <h2>9.2: Read Only and Shared Instances</h2>
        <p>For a performance optimisation when using the cache you can inform Ebean that you want "read only" entities. If you ask for "read only" entities Ebean can give you the instance that is in the cache rather than creating a new copy (creating a new instance and copying the data from the cached instance).</p>
        <p>To be safe in al owing many threads to share the same instances (from the cache) Ebean ensures that these instances can not be mutated. It sets flags (sharedInstance=true, readOnly=true) and any attempt to modify the entity (via setters or putfields) results in an IllegalStateException being thrown.</p>

{% highlight java %}// Cache countries. Use readOnly=true so unless explicitly
// stated in the query we will return read only/shared instances
@CacheStrategy(readOnly=true,warmingQuery="order by name")
@Entity
@Table(name="o_country")
public class Country {
{% endhighlight %} 

<p>Note that Countries is a good candidate for a default setting of readOnly=true. This is because (for my application) country information is very rarely changed. The application code mostly treats the countries as read only.</p>
<p>Now, whenever we get a country (via direct query or indirectly via relationships/joins) unless we explictly say query.setReadOnly(false) we are going to get back readOnly instances that we will not be able to mutate.</p>

{% highlight java %}
// we will use the cache .. and the instance
// in the cache is returned to us (not a copy)
Country country = Ebean.find(Country.class, "NZ");
// this country instance is readOnly
Assert.assertTrue(Ebean.getBeanState(country).isReadOnly());
try {
    // we can't modify a readOnly bean
    // …  a IllegalStateException is thrown
    country.setName("Nu Zilund");
    Assert.assertFalse("Never get here",true);
} catch (IllegalStateException e){
    Assert.assertTrue("This is readOnly",true);
}
// explicitly state we want a MUTABLE COPY
// … not the same instance as the one in cache
// … a copy is made and returned instead
Country countryCopy = Ebean.find(Country.class)
    .setReadOnly(false)
    .setId("NZ").findUnique();
    // we can mutate this one
    countryCopy.setName("Nu Zilund");
    // save it, automatically maintaining the cache ...
    // evicting NZ from the Country bean cache and
    // clearing the Country query cache
    Ebean.save(countryCopy);
{% endhighlight %} 

        <h2>Shared Instances</h2>
        <p>Ebean sets a sharedInstance flag on a bean whenever it is put into the cache. This is used to ensure that the bean is always treated in a read only fashion (and can be safely shared by multiple threads concurrently).</p>
        <p>You can invoke lazy loading on a sharedInstance. When that occurs the sharedInstance flag is propagated to the lazily loaded beans. If you lazy load a col ection (list, set or map) then the col ection is also marked with the sharedInstance flag and that means you can't add or remove elements from the collection (list, set or map).</p>
        <p>A sharedInstance and al  its associated beans and col ections are are all ensured to be read only and can be safely shared by multiple threads concurrently.</p>
        
        <h2>9.4: Automatic Cache Maintenance</h2>
        <p>When you save entity beans or use an Update or SqlUpdate, Ebean will automatically invalidate the appropriate parts of the cache.</p>
        <p>If you save a entity bean that results in an update and there is a matching bean in the cache it will be evicted automatically from the cache at commit time.</p>
        <p>If you save an entity bean that results in an insert then the bean cache is not effected.</p>
        <p>Whenever <i><b>ANY</b></i> change is made (insert/update or delete) the entire query cache for that bean type is invalidated.</p>

        <h2>9.5: Handling External Modification (via stored procedures etc)</h2>
        <p>When you save/delete beans via Ebean.save() and Ebean.delete() etc Ebean will automatically maintain its cache (removing cached beans and cached queries as appropriate). However, you may often find yourself modifying the database outside of Ebean.</p>
        <p>For example, you could be using other frameworks, your own JDBC code, stored procedures, batch systems etc. When you do so (and you are using Ebean caching) then you can inform Ebean so that it invalidates appropriate parts of its cache.</p>

{% highlight java %}
// inform Ebean that some rows have been inserted and updated
// on the o_country table.
// … Ebean will maintain the appropriate caches.
boolean inserts = true;
boolean updates = true;
boolean deletes = false;
Ebean.externalModification("o_country", inserts, updates, deletes);
// clearAll() caches via the ServerCacheManager ...
ServerCacheManager serverCacheManager = 
Ebean.getServerCacheManager();
// Clear all the caches on the default/primary EbeanServer
serverCacheManager.clearAll();
// clear both the bean and query cache
// for Country beans ...
serverCacheManager.clear(Country.class);
// Warm the cache of Country beans Ebean.runCacheWarming(Country.class);
{% endhighlight %} 

        <h2>9.6: @CacheStrategy - automatically using the bean cache</h2>
        <p>The easiest way to use caching is to specify the @CacheStrategy annotation on the entity class. This means that Ebean will try to use the bean cache as much as possible when it fetches beans of that type.</p>

{% highlight java %}
// Cache countries. Use readOnly=true so unless explicitly
// stated in the query we will return read only/shared instances
@CacheStrategy(readOnly=true,warmingQuery="order by name")
@Entity
@Table(name="o_country")
public class Country {
    // automatically use the cache
    Country country = Ebean.find(Country.class,"NZ");
    // references automatically use the cache too
    Country countryRef = Ebean.getReference(Country.class,"NZ");
    // hit the country cache automatically via join
    Customer customer = Ebean.find(Customer.class, 1);
    Address billingAddress = customer.getBillingAddress();
    Country c2 = billingAddress.getCountry();
{% endhighlight %}

        <b>ReadOnly</b> 
        <p>The readOnly attribute of @CacheStrategy is used to determine if by default Ebean should return the same instance from the cache (instances in the cache are readOnly and effectively immutable) or whether Ebean should create a new instance and copy the data from the cached bean onto the new instance.</p>
        <p>The readOnly attribute of @CacheStrategy is the "default" Ebean will use unless you explicitly specify the readOnly attribute of the query.</p>

{% highlight java %}
// explicitly state we want a MUTABLE COPY
// … not the same instance as the one in cache
// … a copy is made and returned instead
Country countryCopy = Ebean.find(Country.class)
    .setReadOnly(false)
    .setId("NZ")
    .findUnique();
// we can mutate this one
countryCopy.setName("Nu Zilund");
// save it, automatically maintaining the cache ...
// evicting NZ from the Country bean cache and
// clearing the Country query cache
Ebean.save(countryCopy);
{% endhighlight %} 

        <h2>9.7: Manually specifing to use the bean cache</h2>
        <p>If you don't use @CacheStrategy you can programmatically specify to use the bean cache via query.setUseCache(true);</p> 

{% highlight java %}
// explicitly state we want to use the bean cache
Customer customer = Ebean.find(Customer.class)
    .setUseCache(true)
    .setId(7)
    .findUnique();
// use readOnly=true to return the 'sharedInstance'
// from the cache (which is effectively immutable)
Customer customer = Ebean.find(Customer.class)
    .setUseCache(true)
    .setReadOnly(true)
    .setId(7)
    .findUnique();
{% endhighlight %} 

        <h2>9.8: Using the Query Cache</h2>
        <p>To use the query cache you have to explicitly specify its use on a query.</p>

{% highlight java %}
// use the query cache
List<Country> list = Ebean.find(Country.class)
    .setUseQueryCache(true)
    .where().ilike("name", "New%")
    .findList();
{% endhighlight %}

        <p>The query cache is general y useful for returning lists that are very infrequently changed. These lists would often be used to populate drop down lists / combo boxes in user interfaces.</p>
        <p>If you are familiar with the term "Lookup Tables" or "Reference Tables" these are typical candidates for using cached queries. Some examples of lookup/reference tables could be, countries, currencies and order status.</p>

        <b>Query cache lists are readOnly by default</b>

{% highlight java %}
// by default the lists returned from the query
// cache are readOnly.  Use setReadOnly(false) to
// return mutable lists
List<Country> list = Ebean.find(Country.class)
    .setUseQueryCache(true)
    .setReadOnly(false)
    .where().ilike("name", "New%")
    .findList();
{% endhighlight %}
